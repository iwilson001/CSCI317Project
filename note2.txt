I'm so sick of this job, I'm bored to death, half my shift I have to work alone.
Maybe I'll rob the place, haha, I could definitely pull it off. I'd have to do a good
job hiding everything, hopefully my deleted messages won't be found. I was asked to fix
a leak in the ceiling, I wasn't hired as a janitor and I certainly am not going to start
now. I wonder if anything here is actually expensive?
