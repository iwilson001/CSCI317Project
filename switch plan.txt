If I can get the replacement in time, I can make the switch easily without anyone questioning anything.  I'm alone on the floor for 3 hours, so I can easily make some excuse to take it down for a bit and bring the new one out.  It's true what they say; if you look like you belong, nobody gives you a second glance.
