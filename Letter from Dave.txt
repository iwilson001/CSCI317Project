Yeah, there's not much to do here, really.  It's pretty quiet most nights, and I don't even have a shift out on the floor.  After closing, I just watch and make sure the janitor's aren't up to anything funny and clock out when Alice comes in at 2.

Sure it's a late night and all, but it's pretty honest work, and I get to sleep in.  Other than that, I think I'm settling in pretty nicely here.

I'll hopefully be home for the 4th this year; depends how much PTO I can bank up to take the whole week off.

Talk to you soon,
