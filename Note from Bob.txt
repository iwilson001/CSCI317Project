Hi Carol,

Do you think you could take a look at the computer during your shift?  Alice spilled coffee on the keyboard and it's been acting funky all morning.  You're better with computers than I am, so hopefully you can get it working right.

Otherwise, I'm heading out to the floor if you need anything.
